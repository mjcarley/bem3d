@mainpage BEM3D: A library for three-dimensional boundary element calculations

BEM3D is a library and collection of associated tools for
three-dimensional boundary element calculations.

@section start Getting started

To solve a basic problem for acoustic scattering from a sphere,
start with:
 @verbatim 
 bem3d-sphere -e 1 -r 3 > sphere.bem
 bem3d-assemble -k 5.0 -i sphere.bem > sphere.mtx
 bem3d-source -k 5.0 -i sphere.bem -p > plane.dat
 bem3d-boundary -i sphere.bem -d plane.dat -o bndry.dat
 bem3d-solve -d bndry.dat -m sphere.mtx -o sphere.dat @endverbatim

These commands generate a spherical surface mesh, assemble the
corresponding BEM matrices for the Helmholtz equation with
wavenumber \f$k=5.0\f$, impose a plane wave boundary condition and
solve for the surface potential. To compute the field radiated by
the surface potential:
 @verbatim
 bem3d-plane -i32 -j32 -v-3,-3,0 -v3,-3,0 -v3,3,0 -v-3,3,0 > plane.gts
 gts2bem3d < plane.gts > plane.bem
 bem3d-field -k 5.0 -i sphere.bem -d sphere.dat -s plane.bem > plane.dat @endverbatim
which generates a GTS file for a plane surface spanning the points
\f$(-3,-3,0)\f$, \f$(3,-3,0)\f$, \f$(3,3,0)\f$ and \f$(-3,3,0)\f$,
converts it to BEM elements and computes the radiated field on the
surface. 

To visualize the results, the data can be output as GMSH .pos files
using the geometry and result files:
 @verbatim
 bem3d2pos -d sphere.dat -i sphere.bem -o sphere.pos
 bem3d2pos -d plane.dat -i plane.bem -o plane.pos 
 gmsh plane.pos sphere.pos @endverbatim

@section what What BEM3D does

A number of different codes are built on the BEM3D library. The main
capabilities are in scattering and potential flow problems (i.e. the
Helmholtz and Laplace equations) with some of these also having
accelerated or fast multipole solvers. Some of these features are
experimental so they are liable to change and you should decide for
yourself whether their performance is adequate for your purposes. The
meshing program of choice is <a href="http://geuz.org/gmsh/">gmsh</a>
and there are a number of programs for converting to and from its data
formats.
