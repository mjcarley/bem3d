@mainpage BEM3D: A library for three-dimensional boundary element calculations

BEM3D is a library and collection of associated tools for
three-dimensional boundary element calculations.

@section start Getting started

A set of basic calculations are distributed with the source code in
the directory \c examples.

To solve a basic problem for acoustic scattering from a sphere, in the
\c Scatter subdirectory start with:
 @verbatim 
 bem3d-sphere -e 1 -r 3 > sphere.bem
 bem3d-assemble -k 5.0 -i sphere.bem > sphere.mtx
 bem3d-function -E 4 -i sphere.bem -F plane.fn -o bc-plane.dat
 bem3d-solve -C sphere.cfg -d bc-plane.dat -m sphere.mtx -o solution.dat
 @endverbatim

These commands generate a spherical surface mesh, assemble the
corresponding BEM matrices for the Helmholtz equation with
wavenumber \f$k=5.0\f$, impose a plane wave boundary condition and
solve for the surface potential. To compute the field radiated by
the surface potential, using a \c gmsh surface
@verbatim
gmsh -2 field.geo

msh2bem3d < field.msh > field.bem

bem3d-field -C sphere.cfg -d solution.dat -i sphere.bem \
	    -s field.bem -o field.dat

@endverbatim
which generates a BEM3D file for a plane surface computes the radiated
field on the surface. 

To visualize the results, the data can be output as GMSH .pos files
using the geometry and result files:
 @verbatim
 bem3d2pos -t "Surface" -i sphere.bem -d solution.dat -o sphere.pos
 bem3d2pos -t "Field" -i field.bem -d field.dat -o field.pos

 gmsh field.pos sphere.pos
 @endverbatim

@section what What BEM3D does

A number of different codes are built on the BEM3D library. The main
capabilities are in scattering and potential flow problems (i.e. the
Helmholtz and Laplace equations) with some of these also having
accelerated or fast multipole solvers. Some of these features are
experimental so they are liable to change and you should decide for
yourself whether their performance is adequate for your purposes. The
meshing program of choice is <a href="http://geuz.org/gmsh/">gmsh</a>
and there are a number of programs for converting to and from its data
formats.
