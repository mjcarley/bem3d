REMOVE STATIC VARIABLES (thread safety) and switch to workspaces

quadrature rules for quad elements;

Sanity checking for element build functions (check edges really do
connect properly) and/or add/check for missing nodes

Parallel implementation of BEM3DMeshData;

Loadable modules;

Green's functions including source and field normals for calculations
in a Burton and Miller stylee (using Francis method?);

Automated attempt to pick wake lines, using motion specification

bem3d-aero to store matrices for rigid body problems

Line continuation in reading motion and function files (to make files
more readable)

General gradient and normal operators, with provision for
discontinuous (especially order 0) elements, noting that collocation
points do not coincide with geometric vertices.

Set of standard scripts for post-installation checking:
    -geometries: sphere, catseye, peanut;
    -automatic estimate of error with internal source (implement as
     BEM3DFunction);
    -refinement check

bem3d-solve: add a memory check with exit if insufficient memory for
matrices

acos checks to avoid NaN errors in htriquad
