REMOVE STATIC VARIABLES (thread safety) and switch to workspaces

quadrature rules for quad elements;

bem3d-data-process for processing of data/solution files;

Sanity checking for element build functions (check edges really do
connect properly) and/or add/check for missing nodes

Integration of quantities on surfaces (e.g. for lift coefficients)

Parallel implementation of BEM3DMeshData;

Loadable modules;

Green's functions including source and field normals for calculations
in a Burton and Miller stylee (using Francis method?);

Adapt quadrature order to required multipole order in mfunc_...

Automated attempt to pick wake lines, using motion specification

bem3d-aero to store matrices for rigid body problems

Command line motion and function variable setting (to override angle
of attack, for example)

Line continuation in reading motion and function files (to make files
more readable)
