REMOVE STATIC VARIABLES (thread safety) and switch to workspaces

output geometry as asymptote file

quadrature rules for quad elements;

AVX acceleration where useful

Threads!

QBX?

WBFMM integration including Laplace for C(x)

Sanity checking for meshes and element build functions (check edges
really do connect properly) and/or add/check for missing nodes (new
program bem3d-check?)

Parallel implementation of BEM3DMeshData;

Loadable modules;

Green's functions including source and field normals for calculations
in a Burton and Miller stylee (using Francis method?);

Automated attempt to pick wake lines, using motion specification

bem3d-aero to store matrices for rigid body problems

Line continuation in reading motion and function files (to make files
more readable)

General gradient and normal operators, with provision for
discontinuous (especially order 0) elements, noting that collocation
points do not coincide with geometric vertices.

Set of standard scripts for post-installation checking:
    -geometries: sphere, catseye, peanut;
    -automatic estimate of error with internal source (implement as
     BEM3DFunction);
    -refinement check

bem3d-solve: add a memory check with exit if insufficient memory for
matrices

acos checks to avoid NaN errors in htriquad
