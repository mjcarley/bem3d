Spherical geometry tests:

./sphere-admittance:    scattering of a plane wave by a sphere of finite
		     	impedance

./point-test-helmholtz: Helmholtz potential and gradient for point
			source inside a sphere

./point-test-laplace: 	Laplace potential and gradient for point source
		      	inside a sphere

./flow-test-laplace:	Laplace solution for flow over a sphere

* Finite impedance sphere

Run

./sphere-admittance

to generate solution for plane-wave incidence. Output is surface
solution, and field on a GMSH generated mesh which can be visualized
using

gmsh field-vis.msh

with an analytical calculation using the first few terms of the series
solution available using

gmsh field-vis-a.msh

The ../octave directory contains the function isphere.m which
evaluates the exact solution, which can be compared to the polar
solution which is output in isphere.dat

* Point source tests

Run

./point-test-[helmholtz | laplace]

to solve for point source inside spherical mesh. Field generated by
spherical surface solution should be identical to that computed
directly from the point source. Output is field potential and gradient
on a square grid, which can be visualized using:

gmsh sphere-field.msh
gmsh sphere-grad.msh

* Potential flow test

./flow-test-laplace

solves for potential flow over a sphere, a standard Laplace
problem. Visualize the velocity field (gradient of potential) with:

gmsh sphere-grad.msh
