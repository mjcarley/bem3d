This directory contains a number of geometries and examples which can
be used to see how to use BEM3D and to check the accuracy and
convergence of calculations.

Geometries: GMSH files to generate sample geometries

Tests:      scripts to run some basic tests (see README in the directory)

Sphere:     scripts for sphere calculations with finite impedance
