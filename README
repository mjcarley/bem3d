The main documentation for BEM3D is in the doxygen-generated files in .../doc

After installation, you can run a test of the toolchain for accuracy
and convergence using the scripts in .../Data. The script

./test-all

will run a test on each of a number of different geometries, with mesh
refinement where possible.
