bem3d2msh converts B\+E\+M3\+D meshes to G\+M\+S\+H .msh format, with the option to include surface data.

The most basic invocation of {\ttfamily bem3d2msh} is \begin{DoxyVerb}bem3d2msh -i input.bem -o output.msh \end{DoxyVerb}
 which generates a mesh file {\ttfamily output.\+msh} which can be viewed with \begin{DoxyVerb}gmsh output.msh \end{DoxyVerb}


An extra option allows you to visualize the surface with solution information added\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}bem3d2msh -i input.bem -d input.dat -f 4 -o output.msh \end{DoxyVerb}
 will generate a file {\ttfamily output.\+msh} which contains the geometry of {\ttfamily input.\+bem} with the nodes coloured according to the value of field 4 of the data block in {\ttfamily input.\+dat} (the field option defaults to 0).

The main purpose of the program is visualization of geometries and data, rather than meshing.
